# Sold on eBay

Recently I've started flipping items on eBay, which is basically buying something below market value, then selling on eBay for a profit. I created this simple extension to assist with looking up what the going rate for an item is.

Just select the text of what you wish to look up, then right click and select "üîç Sold on eBay" from the context menu
